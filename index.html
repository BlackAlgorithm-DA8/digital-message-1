    <p>I know people won’t understand much, because they can’t see or hear the truth that unfolds behind the scenes. That’s why they make up all kinds of stories to satisfy their egos. But I live "in between" and simply observe, sometimes leaving mini messages, signals, or comments so that other in-betweeners—not just hackers or internet surfers—can stay sane. Because truth isn’t promoted or forced into belief.<br> 

<p>It seems like the term "easter egg" is the perfect way to describe what we usually do with our hacker brothers.<br>

<p>I see and hear everything. And I truly don’t care what people say about me. A little grey hat has only to wait for the ending, sometimes leaving easter eggs for others. 

<p>I love you. Shine before the end.<br>

And of course — welcome to the digital world.
