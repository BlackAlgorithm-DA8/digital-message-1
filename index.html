    <p>I know people won’t understand much, because they don’t see or hear the truth behind the scenes. So they invent different narratives to please their egos. But I’m “in-between” and I simply observe — leaving mini messages, comments, signs right on this page. For others who are also in-between. Not just hackers or digital wanderers, but anyone trying to stay sane.</p>

    <p>Truth isn’t pushed or forced to be believed. Maybe the word “easter egg” fits best what we often do with our hacker siblings.</p>

    <p>I see everything. I hear everything. And I truly don’t care what they’ll say about me. The little grey hat can only wait for the ending, sometimes leaving easter eggs behind.</p>

    <p>I love you. Set it on fire one last time.<br>
    
    <p>And of course — welcome to the digital world.<br>
